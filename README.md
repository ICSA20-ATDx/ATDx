# ATDx: Building an Architectural Technical Debt Index, replication Package (ICSA 2020)

This repository is a companion page for the paper _"ATDx: Building an Architectural Technical Debt Index"_, submitted to [ICSA 2020](http://icsa-conferences.org/2020/index.html).

It contains all the material required to replicate our viability investigation, including (i) the scripts utilized to mine the raw experimental data, (ii) the scripts utilized for data processing and statistical analysis, and (iii) the entirety of the raw and processed results gathered for the investigation.

The comprehensive dataset of initial raw data mined for the viability investigation is made available, due to size limitations, at the following dedicated repository [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3595502.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3595502)

Content
---------------
The entirety of the experiment data required for the replication and analysis of the experiment are provided in three separate folders, namely:

* [data](https://github.com/ICSA20-ATDx/ATDx/tree/master/data) - Raw and processed data of the viability investigation
* [rule_classification](https://github.com/ICSA20-ATDx/ATDx/tree/master/rule_classification) - Initial rule set and architectural rule set (including _Gr_ and _ATDD_ mapping process data).
* [scripts](https://github.com/ICSA20-ATDx/ATDx/tree/master/scripts) 
    * [analysis_scripts](https://github.com/ICSA20-ATDx/ATDx/tree/master/scripts/analysis_scripts) - Scripts adopted to mine via [SonarCloud API](https://sonarcloud.io/) the data of the viability investigation.
    * [mining_scripts](https://github.com/ICSA20-ATDx/ATDx/tree/master/scripts/mining_scripts) - Scripts adopted for data processing and statistical analysis.


For further information on the content of the folders see the following Directory Structure Overview.
